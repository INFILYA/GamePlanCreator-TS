      the content will be periodically updated. At the moment, there is no actual statistical
      database available. However, it will be populated starting from the 2023-2024 PVLU season.

      Additionally, the program will provide you with the opportunity to visualize your plans
      through a user-friendly graphical interface. It will visually display the direction of attacks
      and serves in a percentage ratio from each zone and for each position of all active PVLU
      players.

      You will also be able to visualize the "loading" of passing zones for the setter, in order to
      effectively choose your team's strategy for blocking and defense. And in the future

      different situations.
